BEFORE USING IT PLEASE CHANGE THE FOLLOWING THINGS OR DEV(friday) WILL NOT RUN.

1. It is recommended to run the python in a virtual environment.
2. The following program is running on python 3.10 if it does not work on later version please use 3.10
3. In main.py on line 28 "model path" please change the model path to where you installed the model
   example = model_path = r"your_directory\vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15" 
4. Assistant name is friday for better speech recognition. Dev is just the name of the program with version v3
5. Also check the ss folder if it is working or not.
6. Recheck everthing, if a library is missing please install it, and check the directories.
7. It is recommended to run it first in VScode.
8. The model i am using is "vosk" for speech recognition, its a great local model less intensive than "whisper"
9. The tts model is "sapi" so the following code will only work for windows
10. You are free to upgrade this program however you like and making it more easier to work on local.
11. You can also contact me on discord if you find some good optimization of code in it.
12. ChatGpt was only used in this program on the code to import vosk model from line 30 - 50 in main.py and it still 
took it 2 hours giving me a buggy code so i fixed some of it mannualy.
13. Thanks to vosk, chatgpt, reddit from where i took inspiration from.
